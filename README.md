# Art Investment Advisor

**Art Investment Advisor** is a Streamlit-based web application designed to help investors evaluate the potential of purchasing a contemporary artwork. It combines objective data-driven criteria on both the **artwork** and the **artist** to produce a recommendation score.

---

## Features

- Evaluate artworks based on:
  - Nature, size, uniqueness, and historical importance.
- Evaluate artists based on:
  - Career length, exhibitions, prizes, representation, and market value.
- Weighted scoring system:
  - **Artist: 75%**
  - **Artwork: 25%**
- Dynamic visual output using **Matplotlib**.
- Simple, clean **Streamlit interface**.

##  Methodology

### Artwork Scoring (out of 20)
| Criterion | Weight | Example Factors |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| Nature | 25% | Painting, Sculpture, Photo, Performance |
| Size | 20% | Monumental, Medium, Small |
| Uniqueness | 40% | Unique piece, Limited series, Large series |
| Historical Value | 15% | Emblematic, Transitional, Commission |

### Artist Scoring (out of 20)
| Criterion | Weight | Example Factors |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| Career Stage | 1/6 | Confirmed, Intermediate, Emerging |
| Exhibitions | 1/6 | Number and type of recent shows |
| Venue Quality | 1/6 | Museum, Fair, Independent |
| Prizes | 1/6 | Laureate, Finalist, None |
| Representation | 1/6 | Blue chip gallery, Local, Independent |
| Market Price | bonus/malus | Low (bonus) or High (malus) |

**Final recommendation index:**

`Final Score = (Artwork Score × 0.25) + (Artist Score × 0.75)`
